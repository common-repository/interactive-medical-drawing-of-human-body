Interactive human basic anatomy with clickable body parts including head, chest, abdomen, etc.

== Description ==
**[LIVE DEMO](https://www.humananatomyillustrations.com/interactive-human-basic-anatomy.html)** and full documentation.

This interactive human body anatomy displays 9 clickable body parts/organs. It gives you the option to customize the links, hover description for each organ/body part through an easy to use visual editor at the dashboard without any coding knowledge, then insert the diagram shortcode `[basic_anatomy]` in any page/post to display the interactive model.

NEW! We added an option to open a modal window when a visitor clicks a body part with the help of the Popup Maker plugin.
